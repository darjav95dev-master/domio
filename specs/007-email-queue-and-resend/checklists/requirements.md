# Specification Quality Checklist: email-queue-and-resend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- The spec mentions `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in Assumptions as a reasonable default mechanism — this is an implementation assumption, not a requirement. The spec itself stays technology-agnostic in the requirements and success criteria.
- Templates are described functionally (what they contain and produce), not visually.
- The spec explicitly bounds scope: the actual enqueue points (lead creation, user invitation, password recovery) belong to other features (F014, F016, F005).
